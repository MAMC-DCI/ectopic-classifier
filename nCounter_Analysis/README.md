# Overview


The analysis code contained in *nCounter_Analysis.Rmd* uses data stored in a folder called *Data*. The contents of the *Data* folder are described in the following subsection.


# Data Folder


- Modeling_Metadata.xls: A Microsoft Excel document with three columns
 - Sample: The sample ID. All Sample IDs start "PUL_" and are followed by a number without any additional characters.
  - Group: AIUP or ECT.
  - Data : Train or Test, indicating the discovery or prospective datasets, respectively.


- data.csv: The file of normalized data generated by nSolver using the export as csv function. Sample names found in this data file appear in a specific format (i.e., 20190301_30102250141220-01_PUL 23_01.RCC). The second row contains the group to which the sample belongs (AIUP, ECT, Adipose, Liver, or Lung), except for the first 5 columns which are empty in row 2. These columns contain "Probe Name", "Accession #", "NS Probe ID", "Class Name", and "Analyte Type", which is indicated in the first row just before the sample names.


# Running the analysis


Start the Docker image used for this analysis (see the upper level README to see how). After navigating to the *nCounter_Analysis* folder and setting it is as the working directory, click "knit".


# Outputs


The step-by-step description of the analysis is contained in *nCounter_Analysis.html*. All tables and figures included in *nCounter_Analysis.html*, plus many additional ones, are stored in the *Results* folder.
